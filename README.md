# Blockchains-Project
For this project, we wrote code that implemented the proposed stablecoin within our research paper. Specifically, this code includes the process of collecting and processing data for each of the assets: Ethereum, USDC, and US Treasury Bonds as well as a variety of the most popular stablecoins. It also implements dynamically changing the collateral ratios with the intention of keeping the proposed stablecoin as close to a peg of 1 with the USD as possible. The graphs that are within the paper were created from changing the time period in the implementation.
